    -> For Swing Trading, you need to use TradingView (for advanced technical/ detailed charting), Stockedge (to use for financial/ homework for the end of the day) and
       Trading terminal (Zerodha).
    -> Trading is to predict or make judgement of the price movement of stock.
    -> In investing, we usually work to get fair value/ intrinsic value of the stock as we compare current price with fair value.
    -> In trading, we say the price of the stock is right, but we need to predict the movement of the stock.
    -> If we think the price of the stock will go up, we usually buy it.
    -> If we think the price of the stock will go down, we usually sell it. 
    -> In the TradingView, at the bottom we see some towers, that is nothing, but volume traded.
    -> You need to study stock price and volume both for technical analysis.
    -> For swing trading, you need to see 3 months to 1 year chart.
    -> For swing trading, we need to see daily charts.
    -> There are three major trends, uptrend (Bull), downtrend (Bear) and consolidation.
    -> When stock breaks previous high and makes new high, we say it as breakout.
    -> When stock breaks previous low and makes new low, we say it as breakdown.
    -> When any trend comes, short chart (2 hours) usually give signal first before daily chart.
    -> When you buy, you see ask price and when you sell you see bid price.
