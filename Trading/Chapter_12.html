<h4><pre>
-> Go to tradingview – select moving average exponential, select the EMA and change it to 21.
-> Repeat the above for 55 days.
-> Repeat the above for 100 days.
-> Repeat the above for 200 days.
-> 21 EMA = 21 is a symbolic of number of trading days in a month.
-> 55 EMA = 55 is a symbolic of number of trading days in a quarter.
-> 100 EMA = 100 is a symbolic number of trading days in a half yearly.
-> 200 EMA = 200 is a symbolic number of trading days in a year.
-> EMA always give weightage to CMP.
-> Why Vivek chooses 21 and 55 is b/c they are also Fibonacci numbers.
-> Typically Moving Average work as a good support.
-> With moving average, you can assess the trend of an instrument in short term, medium term and long term.
-> If the stock is above all the four tenures, then it is positive(uptrend). So, typically moving average is a trend identifier.
-> There are two ways to find the trend – 
-> Either draw trend line.
-> The second is that you are following moving average. If the moving average says this stock is moving above all the four tenures, it means it is +ve trend.
-> You can also use the moving average as stoploss. Suppose you bought a stock, you can make a model that if this stock is above 200 or 100 moving average, then I will buy it.
-> And, if it go down to 100 EMA then I will sell it, or if it goes down to 55 then I will sell it.
-> The more it is near the moving average, the more favorable is the risk-reward. Because it will have small stoploss.
-> You add demand, supply with moving average to get more accuracy/conviction about sector and stocks.
-> If all the four lines converge at one point, it denotes a big movement can happen from here.
-> Go to stockedge.com – scans – technical scans – EMA – close crossing 20 EMA from below – add all 4 EMA.
-> From that scan you can find out which stock is giving moving average crossovers.
-> Crossovers = When 21 period moving average is going below 55 period moving average, it means in short term, the stock is going negative.
-> So, this crossover of moving average becomes a very good indication of something which is happening in the stock.
