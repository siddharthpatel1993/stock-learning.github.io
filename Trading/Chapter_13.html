<h4><pre>

-> The meaning of volume is, how many people have traded at particular price point. It contains both intraday and overnight.
-> If it is overnight, then it must have converted to delivery and if it is intraday, then it must have squared up on the same day.
-> Certain percentage of volume will convert into delivery. So, delivery is also an important parameter that one can see.
-> You will not get delivery in tradingview, you will get this in stockedge.
-> At every price point, the traded volume is being addded and shown as cumulative for that period.
-> So if it is 3 months, than all the trades in 3 minutes will have open, high, low, close. After that , it has a volume which is cumulative of all the trades which has 
   happend.
-> There is theory in the market, there is an operator in every stock. The intent of the operator if you want to understand, the volume is the first indicator.
-> Because if the opeator works in the market then there would be reflection in the volume.
-> So, if you observe the price and volume together, then you will understand the intent of the operator.
-> To check the delivery, goto stockedge - search reliance - deliveries.
-> VWAP = Volume Weighted Avergage Price 
-> We can get confirmation, there is delivery. But how will confirm if it is bought or sold.
-> We need to confirm the above point using green or red volume indicator in tradingview.
