-> The meaning of volume is, how many people have traded at particular price point. It contains both intraday and overnight.
-> If it is overnight, then it must have converted to delivery and if it is intraday, then it must have squared up on the same day.
-> In Candlestick, all the trades, adding their volume at every price point, will give you total volume of the candle. 
-> Certain percentage of volume will convert into delivery. So, delivery is also an important parameter that one can see.
-> In technical Analysis one of the most important thing is that price behaviour is supported by volume.
-> If the price is beahving without volume, then it means that someone is fooling us.
-> So, whenever you see the chart of technical Analysis, always remeber that it is very important to track price movement with volume.

-> You will not get delivery in tradingview, you will get this in stockedge.
-> At every price point, the traded volume is being addded and shown as cumulative for that period.
-> So if it is 3 months, than all the trades in 3 minutes will have open, high, low, close. After that , it has a volume which is cumulative of all the trades which has 
   happend.
-> There is theory in the market, there is an operator in every stock. The intent of the operator if you want to understand, the volume is the first indicator.
-> Because if the opeator works in the market then there would be reflection in the volume.
-> So, if you observe the price and volume together, then you will understand the intent of the operator.
-> To check the delivery, goto stockedge - search reliance - deliveries.

-> VWAP = Volume Weighted Avergage Price 
-> VWAP in layman term means, that whole day this stock VWAP is 2046.78. You can assume that opeartor took this stock around this price or sold it.
-> But has to confirm if it is bought or sold? We can confirm through tradingview red or green tower.
-> Always analyse the stock in 15 minutes rather than a day.
-> Draw horizontal at VWAP. VWAP is for the day is important level when more delivery had happend that day, beacuse more trade is being on this price,
   so probably this is good deamand zone or supply zone.

-> We can get confirmation, there is delivery. But how will confirm if it is bought or sold.
-> We need to confirm the above point using green or red volume indicator in tradingview.
-> Why volume tower is green and red? It means in red tower, the more is sold in the volume. In green tower, the more in the volume is bought.
-> If the price movement has gone below the important line, and there are red volumes also, it means the operator is definitely existing.
-> Whenever a green candle is made, big chandle made. Whenever a red candle is made, small chandles are made. That means, when the operator has come to buy, he has bought a lot.
   And when someone has sold, then maybe weak people have sold.
