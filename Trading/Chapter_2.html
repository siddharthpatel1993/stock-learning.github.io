-> Technical Analysis not only works for stocks, but it also works for commodities, currency or bitcoin.
-> When you trade make sure the exchange has the volume. It makes it easy to trade if you have enough buyers and sellers.
-> MCX exchange for commodities and NSE for equity and derivatives.
-> There are different types of charts, but we only use line (just closing price), candlestick (OHLC) and Bar charts (OHLC) for simplicity.
-> If the stock is bullish (close > open), the candle will be green.
-> If the stock is bearish (open > close), the candle will be red.
-> When low makes high and high makes high, it is said to be uptrend.
-> When low makes low and high makes low, it is said to be down trend.

-> Correction and retracement happen in uptrend, when the stock comes down a bit and returns from the support.
-> You can draw parallel channel (same range) for consolidation, uptrend or downtrend.
-> There is point where lots of buyers are there, who doesn’t allow the stock price to go down. They create support, that is called support zone or demand zone.
-> There is a point where lots of sellers are there, who don’t allow the stock price to go up. That is called resistance zone or supply zone.
-> If supply is more than demand, the price will go down.
-> If the demand is higher than supply, the price will go up.
-> As a trader, it is your responsibility to find out demand zone(support) and supply zone(resistance).
-> Whenever the stock price comes near the demand zone, you know the big people are ready to buy.
-> Whenever the stock price comes near the supply zone, you know the big people are ready to sell.
-> When it breaks the supply zone, it is called breakout.

-> If you buy at breakout(new demand zone) or at demand zone area, then there would be less chance of loss and risk-reward ratio would be favorable.
-> If the stock breakout and sustains, that means it is ready for new era.
-> To confirm if the breakout is correct and it is not false breakout, check the number of volumes traded. If it is high, then it is having a high chance of breakout.
-> If you trade in any stock, first step is to find out the trend of the stock.
-> If you want to trade, check first it is uptrend (duration at least 5-6 months). Not every price should be traded in uptrend, every stock has right price. 
   Right price is decided by the demand zone and supply zone.
-> Always assess the risk and reward in the stocks before trade. Buy it at demand zone or after breakout (new demand zone).
-> At the end of the day, use stockedge and make objective is that in which stock risk and reward is favorable, filter it and trade in that next day.
