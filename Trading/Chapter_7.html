-> What does indices mean? Well, Exchanges have made indices, which represent certian things. Like nifty is an index, which represents the indian market.
   Sensex is an index, which represents the india market.
-> Represnt the indian market means that the main companies in India, Nifty has 50, Sensex has 30. 
-> If they are made into an index, which represnts them cumulatively, then that process is called creating an index out of these stocks.
-> Weightages would be different for all the companies in the index.
-> How do you calculate weightage? Free float is used as weightage. So, free float means that the shares in the public are part of the free float.

-> To check the indices how they have performed from last 1 month, go to Stockedge – Indices – Nifty Metal.
-> Go to tradingview – create watchlist (sectors) – click on ‘+’, search for nifty metal – add it, then search for company under it and add it.
